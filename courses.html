<h1 id="javascript">1. Javascript</h1>
<p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is one of the core technologies of
the World Wide Web. It is used as a client-side programming language by 97.8 percent
of all websites. JavaScript was originally used only to develop web browsers, but they
are now used for server-side website deployments and non-web browser applications
as well.</p>
<p>Javascript was created in 1995 and was initially known as LiveScript. However, Java
was a very popular language at that time, so it was advertised as a “younger brother” of
Java. As it evolved over time, JavaScript became a fully independent language.
Nowadays, JavaScript is often confused with Java, and although there are some
similarities between them, the two languages are distinct.

find it essential to learn PHP, as this language is used to build more than 80% of
websites on the Internet, including notable sites like Facebook and Yahoo.</p>
<p>Programmers mainly use PHP mainly to write server-side scripts. But developers can
also use this language to write command-line scripts, and programmers with high-level
PHP coding skills can also use it to develop desktop applications.</p>
<p>PHP is considered a relatively easy language to learn for beginning developers. PHP
professionals have access to several dedicated online communities, making it easy to
get support and answers to questions.</p>
